Implement user database for user preference on certain restaurants
- user would have a simple choice to alter their rating of a restaurant when a run completes
    - a choice of 'Not right now' or 'I hate this place'
    - rating is saved to db and affects future runs as every run would load user preference/ratings

Implement a delivery option
